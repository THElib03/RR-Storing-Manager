# RR Storing Manager
#### Actual state of the project:
- CRUD for all the tables.
 - Added al checks to avoid SQL errors while adding, modifying or removing table's rows.

#### Pending
- Proper logic in the tables when doing changes (removing stock from a resource when a sale is made or adding when a donation is made).
- Sales calculator.
- Search tools for the tables panels (Coming in next updates).
- Search tools for the CRUD panels, so there's no need to select a row before entering one if these panels (this should include a JBeans component).


Latest release (v0.0.7) [here](https://github.com/THEliberator03/RR-Storing-Manager/releases/tag/early-alpha)
